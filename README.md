# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as the type of house, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square meters of the house. The model is implemented in Python using scikit-learn and numpy libraries.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict house prices given specific features of the house. The model uses historical data on house prices and related features to learn patterns and make predictions on new data.

## Prerequisites
Before using the model, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- pandas (for data manipulation, if applicable)

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
```

## How to Use

To use the house price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. **Train the Model**: Train the regression model using your own dataset or sample data. Use the provided Python script to preprocess the data, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.

2. **Save the Model**: After training, save the trained model using scikit-learn's joblib or pickle module.

3. **Prediction Application**: Create a simple GUI application (using Tkinter or other GUI libraries) that takes user inputs for the type of house, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square meters. Use the trained model to predict the house price based on the entered features.

## Model Details

The regression model used for house price prediction is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It combines one-hot encoding for categorical features (type of house and location) and feature scaling using standardization (for numerical features). The model is trained on historical data with target house prices to learn the relationship between features and prices.

The evaluation metrics used for the model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) Score. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and performance.
